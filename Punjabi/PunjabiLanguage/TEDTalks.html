          <h1>TED Talks on Language Learning</h1>
            <p>
              This webpage lists some of my favourite talks on language acquisition and the benefits of learning a new language.
              I have listed them in the order that I had discovered them and have included a summary and a few words on what I found interesting/inspiring.

            <strong>1. Chris Lonsdale: How to learn any language in six months</strong>
            </br>
            </br> 
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            </br>
            </br> 
            Chris Lonsdale asks: <strong>How do you help a normal adult learn a new language quickly, easily and effectively?</strong>
            </br>
            </br>
            He claims that anyone can learn a new language in 6 months.
            </br>
            Immersion per se does not work - a drowning man can't learn to swim.  He breaks down language acquistion into 5 principles and 5 actions:
            </br>
            </br>
            <strong>Principles:</strong></br>  
            <ol>
              <li>Focus on language content that is relevant to you</li>
              <li>Start communicating in your new language from Day 1</li>
              <li>Once you have comprehensible input, you will automatically start to acquire the language (unconsciously)</li>
              <li>There is a physiological aspect involved. Train your face to make the sounds and your brain/ears to hear them</li>
              <li>Psychophysiological state matters - relax be comfortable with less that perfection</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Actions:</strong></br>  
            <ol>
              <li>Listen a lot: ie. "brain soaking"</li>
              <li>Get the meaning first (focus on the words later)</li>
              <li>Have fun and start mixing: 10 nouns + 10 verbs + 10 adjectives = 1000 combinations</li>
              <li>Focus on the core of the language - get the high frequency content - in English, 3000 words is 98% of daily language</li>
              <li>Get a language parent - comprehensible input environment - 4 rules</li>
              <ol>
                <li>They will work hard to understand what you mean</li>
                <li>Never correct mistakes</li>
                <li>Confirms understanding by using correct language</li>
                <li>Uses words the learner knows</li>
              </ol>
              <li>Copy the face</li>
              <li>Direct connect to mental images</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Takeways:</strong>
            </br> 
            </br>
            What most stood out to me in this talk was principle #5.  Especially the bit about the language parent never correcting your mistakes. 
            I am sure it has to do with helping to keep one in a dopamine state in which learning happens more comfortably.
            It takes real skill for one to teach a language without ever correcting mistakes. 
            One can repeat back to the other what they are saying as if to confirm they were heard, while at the same time indicating the correct way of saying something. 
            This is far more effective, however, than simply giving a correction, although demands patience, gentleness and energy and enthusiasm on part of the language parent. 
            This is an admirable skill.

            <strong>2. Mia Nacamulli: The benefits of a bilingual brain</strong>
            </br>
            </br> 
            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            </br>
            </br> 
            Mia Nacamulli talks about how the brain behaves differently in childhood and adulthood and what this means for people who have acquired a second language as an adult.
            Some of the benefits on the brain of bilingualism are highlighted in this video. They include a strengthened dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that plays a large role in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>executive function</li>
            <li>problem solving</li>
            <li>switching between tasks</li>
            <li>focusing while filtering out irrelevant information</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Nacamulli finishes off by saying that bilingualism "makes your brain more healthy, complex and actively engaged."
            She even goes a step further in urging us to do ourself a "favour" (if we have not already) and learn a second language.

            This short video provides some brief, interesting science that provides some compelling reasons to learn a second language.

            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            </br>
            </br> 
            Polyglot Lýdia Machová shares with us the surprising finding that language acquisition is expedited by fun, customized learning methods.
            She also talks about the importance of regularly employed systems in language learning and gives examples of methods that other language learners have used to have fun while learning.

            This video supports the notion that language acquisition works best when not forced.  A gentler approach works better.
