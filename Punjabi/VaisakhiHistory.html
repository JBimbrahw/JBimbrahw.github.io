    <p class="preamble">
        Vaisakhi is a spring festival that is very important for Sikhs.  It is a celebration that commemorates the birth of Khalsa on the first of Baisakh (April 13), 1699.

        The article below is an excerpt from the book, "The Sikh Gurus" by Madhuban Educational Books.  The article summarizes the events that lead to the founding of the Khalsa Panth.

        <p class="header">FOUNDATION OF THE KHALSA PANTH</p>
        
        <p class="summary">
            Guru Gobind Singh had such an imposing personality that whoever came in contact with him turned into his devotee or a warrior-sadhu. Like Guru Nanak he wanted to read the society of its sick caste-system. He wished to create a casteless society, where people stood by each other in the hour of need and were bound by the principle of “Oneness of God”.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He called his Sikhs ‘Khalsas’, the pure ones.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On the 1st of Baisakh (April 13) 1699, the young Guru assembled his Sikhs at Anandpur (where now stands the famous Gurdwara called Sri Keshgarh).  He baptized five of them known as the ‘Punj Pyaras’ or the Five Beloved members of a fighting fraternity. This brotherhood he named as the ‘Khalsa’ or the pure ones.  He gave them a new surname ‘Singh’ (lion) to be attached to their first name.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Guru said, “Let all embrace one creed.  Adopt one form of adoration and become brothers.  Let no one deem to be superior to another.  Let men of all castes receive my ‘baptism’, eat out of one dish and feel no disgust or contempt for one another.”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The five Sikhs were told by the Guru to repeat ‘Wahe Guru’ and the preamble of Japji Sahib.  He then gave them five palmsfull of amrit to drink.  He sprinkled it five times on their hair and eyes.  He made them take an oath to observe the five K’s namely, Kesh (hair), Kangha (comb), Kirpan (dagger), Kaccha (short drawers) and Kara (steel bracelet).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When the Guru had thus administered baptism to his five tried Sikhs, he stood before them with clasped hands and begged them to administer baptism to him.  They were astonished at this proposal and expressed their unworthiness to accomplish the task.  The Guru bowed before them and said, “The Khalsa is the Guru and the Guru is the Khalsa.  There is no difference between you and me.”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Upon hearing this many others prepared to receive baptism.  After them many thousands were baptized.  Thus was born the ‘Khalsa’, a nation of saint-soldiers amongst whom there were no distinctions of caste, creed or sex.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The new Khalsa Panth was hailed by a majority of the people who belonged to the so-called low-caste or out-castes.  At last they saw hope of liberation from the evil social systems.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The new religion placed women shoulder to shoulder with men.  Earlier even high caste women were not permitted to take part in Vedic rites.  Since Guru Gobind Singh worked for ending the prejudices and evils of the caste system, irrespective of caste, creed, or religion, both men and women could dine together in the Guru's langar.  They also enjoyed the freedom of reading religious books and participating in religious rites.
